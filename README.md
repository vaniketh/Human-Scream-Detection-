## Introduction

Crime rates are rising globally, often due to delayed law enforcement responses caused by a lack of accurate and timely information. This project aims to develop a system that detects human screams in real-time using machine learning, which can help provide immediate alerts and potentially reduce crime response times.

## Methodology

### Approach
The system utilizes machine learning and deep learning models, specifically:
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**

### Key Features
- Binary classification (scream vs. non-scream)
- Integration of advanced audio processing techniques

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Purpose**: Detect human screams in audio data.
- **Dataset**:
  - Positive Class: 2,000 scream instances
  - Negative Class: 3,000 non-scream sounds
- **Functionality**: Categorizes audio using the decision function \( f(x) = \text{sign}(w \cdot x + b) \).

### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- **Role**: Enhances detection reliability by validating SVM outputs.
- **Capabilities**: Recognizes complex patterns in audio data using deep learning.

## Data Processing

- **Tool Used**: LibRosa library for feature extraction.
- **Key Feature Extracted**: Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).
- **Importance of MFCCs**: Essential for understanding speech and audio characteristics.

## System Integration

- **Platform Used**: TensorFlow for model storage and execution.
- **Integration Benefits**: Ensures seamless collaboration between SVM and MLP models for robust detection performance.

## Results

The system achieved an accuracy of 75.5% in scream detection on test datasets. It displays results as "Scream Detected" or "No Scream Detected."

## Visual Results

Here are visual examples of the system's outputs:
- **No Scream Detected**: [Image]
- **Scream Detected**: [Image]

## Conclusion

The project successfully implemented a scream detection system using SVM and MLP models. Future enhancements include real-time classification capabilities and SMS notifications for detected screams.
